Please read on for benefits, track descriptions, requirements, and process details.</p> <h2>Important Dates</h2> <ul> <li>September 29, 2015: Abstract submissions will open</li> <li>January 11, 2016: Abstract submission deadline</li> <li>February 5, 2016: Accept/Decline notifications sent</li> <li>March 4, 2016: Presentations/slide decks due for first round of review</li> <li>March 25, 2016: Presentations/slide decks due for final approval</li> <li>April 26, 2016: Kafka Summit 2016 in San Francisco, CA</li> </ul> <p>Visit <a href=http://www.kafka-summit.org>www.kafka-summit.org</a> for more details related to the event.</p> <h2>Speaker Benefits</h2> <ul> <li>Publication of your abstract and name on the Kafka Summit website.</li> <li>One complimentary pass to Kafka Summit 2016.</li> <li>Exposure to hundreds of Kafka community members</li> </ul> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>This inaugural conference brings together the Apache Kafka community. Attendees will engage with experts and leading production users of Kafka, stream processing frameworks, and related projects. Learn where the project development is headed and how companies are using Kafka for large-scale real-time data integration and stream processing in a variety of applications.</p> <p>We invite the community to submit proposals to present at Kafka Summit. Our goal is to educate both current and new users. We’re looking for proposals around the following areas</p> <h2>Development track</h2> <p>Apache Kafka has quickly become the standard for storing streaming data, resulting in a large ecosystem of libraries and tools leveraging its ability to handle massive data with low latency. Talks in this track will describe the design and implementation of these tools -- anything from stream processing frameworks to integration with systems for query processing, logging, and metrics, to data connectors.</p> <h2>Operations track</h2> <p>Apache Kafka is deployed in thousands of companies worldwide, with the largest deployment of Kafka at LinkedIn, where Kafka scales to more than 1.1 trillion messages per day. Talks in this track will focus on Kafka operations and will include examples of, and recommendations on, tooling and monitoring for Kafka administration. Speakers will address common Kafka problems and workarounds, and will discuss best practices around deployment of Kafka on-premise as well as in the cloud.</p> <h2>Applications track</h2> <p>Organizations are hungry for applications that capitalize on Kafka’s ability to ingest, store, and distribute stream data at scale. To address these end customer needs, application developers and data scientists need a thorough understanding of Kafka’s capabilities, its integration tools ecosystem, and best practices for using Kafka to build data-intensive applications.</p> <p>Sessions in this track will address key considerations for application developers and data scientists in their use of Kafka, using both real-world case studies and deep discussions of architecture topics, design patterns, and integration tools and techniques.</p> <h2>Basic Submission Requirements</h2> <ul> <li>The Call for Papers process for Kafka Summit 2016 opens on September 29, 2015 and closes on January 11, 2016. Abstracts received after January 11, 2016 will not be considered for inclusion in the 2016 conference.</li> <li>All abstracts must be written in English.</li> <li>Abstracts can only be submitted online via the Call for Papers submission system on our website; submissions by fax, post or email will not be considered.</li> <li>Abstracts should be no more than 300 words and should include a high level overview of what you hope to accomplish in the session.</li> <li>When using abbreviations or acronyms, always spell out the full name or title the first time when referencing, and put the abbreviation or acronym in parenthesis next to it. Thereafter, you can begin using the abbreviation or acronym by itself. Do not assume your audience knows what an abbreviation or acronym stands for.</li> <li>Avoid ALL CAPS (unless the official spelling denotes the use of all caps), exclamation points, and other casual/personal styles of writing in the title or abstract content.</li> <li>Ask someone outside of your field of work to proofread your title and abstract before submission. While he/she may not understand all of the technical terms or references, they can help catch grammatical errors and determine if you are communicating the goals of your session effectively.</li> <li>If English is not your native language, we recommend that you have your abstract reviewed by a native speaker before submission for translation clarity.</li> <li>Once submitted, you will not be able to modify your proposal, so please review your abstracts carefully.</li> </ul> <h2>Tips for Creating Effective Titles for Submission</h2> <ul> <li>Do not use abbreviations or acronyms under any circumstances in the titles of your submissions.</li> <li>Do not use competitor or other company names in your submission titles. If you are highlighting other companies within your session, you can adopt these names within the session description.</li> <li>Start with the benefit</li> <li>Use clear and concise language that attendees will immediately understand. The agenda will host many sessions and attendees need to easily identify sessions of interest.</li> </ul> <h2>Tips for Writing Winning Abstracts</h2> <ul> <li>Avoid beginning your session description with the phrase, “In this session we will…”, or “In this session you will learn…”. It does not add value and becomes tedious on an agenda of many sessions. Instead try a rhetorical question, or an interesting industry data point to start your session abstract.</li> <li>Ensure that what you submit will be what you present. Nothing will upset attendees more than signing up for a session that is not what it is advertised to be.</li> <li>Your abstract should generate enthusiasm – make sure your content is relevant, but also generates excitement. What invaluable information will be shared during the session?</li> <li>Be Original. Attendees want to see new presentations that cover the latest innovations in technology. Take the time to create well-written titles, abstracts, outlines, and the key takeaways for your submission. A thoughtful proposal will have a better chance of being selected and if accepted, will be seen by hundreds of attendees once published on the event website.</li> <li>Be Educational. Confluent requires that sessions focus on the educational value of the presentation. Be sure that your proposal doesn’t sound like a sales pitch but rather an exciting opportunity for attendees to learn something new.</li> <li>Show Conviction. Your abstract doesn’t have to read like a car commercial but the reader wants to know that you care about your topic.</li> <li>Be Timely. Make sure your topic is relevant to the audience you’re targeting. Review the content topics before submitting a session.</li> <li>Be Concrete. Don’t let your abstract be too abstract.</li> </ul> <h2>Typical Reasons for Abstract Rejection</h2> <ul> <li>The abstract is poorly written—ideas are not clear, goals are not established, there are grammatical errors, etc.</li> <li>The content is not relevant to the indicated audience or track.</li> <li>The session value is not clearly identified.</li> <li>The session topic is not unique or overlaps with another more appropriate abstract.</li> </ul> <h2>Speaker Information</h2> <ul> <li>Speakers – Sessions will be selected based on the content as well as the proposed speaker(s). Speakers should have extensive experience presenting at conferences of a similar nature.</li> <li>Quality over Quantity – Take time to review your proposal before submission. Submitting multiple session proposals will not increase your chances of having a session selected for Kafka Summit 2016.</li> </ul> <h2>Submission Confirmation</h2> <p>After submitting your proposal, a confirmation email will be sent to the author indicated within the submission profile.</p> <h2>Abstract Review</h2> <p>Paper selection will be made on the basis of overall quality, interest to Kafka Summit attendees, relevance to the conference, originality and depth of the work, and commitment to in-person presentation at the conference. All submitted abstracts will go through a comprehensive review process by an internal committee of subject matter experts.</p> <h2>Abstract Selection, Next Steps and Questions</h2> <p>You will be notified no later than February 5, 2016 if your proposal has been accepted for the Kafka Summit 2016 agenda or not. <!-- If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:organizer@kafka-summit.org">organizers@kafka-summit.org</a> --> </p> </div> </div> <!-- footer --> <div class=footer> <div class=container> <div class=row> <p>Organized by <img src=images/2904412f.confluent-footer-02.png alt="Organized by Confluent"></p> <p>Questions?
